## Features ✨
- **PRAW Integration** 📥: The application integrates with the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) API to extract high-quality text data from Reddit. This data is then used as input for the content generation process.
- **GPT-based Text Generation** 📝: Using a pre-trained GPT model, the software generates text prompts that serve as the basis for YouTube Shorts scripts.
- **StableDiffusion Image Synthesis** 🖼️: Stability AI's StableDiffusion model is utilized to generate corresponding visual content for each YouTube Short script. This adds a visually appealing aspect to the generated Shorts.
- **Video Rendering** 🎬: The generated text and image content are merged, and the YouTube Shorts are rendered as downloadable video files that can be directly uploaded to YouTube.
